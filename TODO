* parse.pl/p2.pl: factor out parsing code into module. Cleanup.
* optim.sh: ugly hack, layers upon layers of "just another small script"
* asmlib: outdated version, but newlib also needs major rework
* tests. half of the obscure options are broken at any moment
* forth-to-bytecode via nasm is a mess: compile-time constants in nasm, other
  constants in the forth part, stuff I don't remember right now...
  lit8/lit32 tracking
* forth compiler: simplify stuff like "1 1 +" and "3 not"
* ":?" words: inside should not be checked for reachability if it isn't clear that they are needed
  (e.g. syscall3 defined as :?-word, syscall7 now required. but should not be required if syscall7
  never used elswehere)
* options that are probably broken: PIC, SMALLINIT, whole 64bit stuff
* parse.pl also has TODO section, check what is still valid...
* Move 'rwx' function to Forth: mprotect only takes 3 arguments.
* Documentation: stack is NOT aligned, esp. with SMALLINIT==3
* Some options interpret empty as false, others as 'use default'. E.g. "FULL=" vs "INLINE="
* r@/i Forth words do not work in MAIN
* INLINEALL keyword to inline everything into a word for speed reasons
* clear distinction/table which word we want asm and which in Forth
* p2.pl really is a mess with pruning/inlining/etc running multiple times for no apparent reason
* WORD macro in macros.asm: what is still needed, what can be refactored/deleted?
* SCALED==0: use base+offset? can we use 16b offsets?
* a mode for WORD_ALIGN==1 without using ecx, but directly eax
* would keeping top-of-stack in a register decrease overall code size? Every indirect access,
  e.g. inc native [SP] is +1 bytes
* p2.pl: Inline/length calculations: branch offsets in if/unless etc. get ignored (also, BRANCH8/32)
* Smaller core:
  * convert store/drop to store1+/drop1+, -2 bytes
  * syscall3_noret -> syscall2_noret, edx can be set as sideeffect of NAND. -1 bytes
  * FULL='': smaller with custom smallinit? use dec bx to get 0xffff, use that as stack size
    Now able to use custom offset/code in offset
  * FULL='': automatically set mem to rwx if needed (variables e.g.)
    Or variables somewhere else?
* Stuff departing from Forth:
  * upper/lowercase is handled inconsistently
  * creating new definitions for words not possible atm
  * "recurse" just an alias for current word name
  * inlining allows to use words before they appear in the source file
  * "." does not support anything besides base 10
  * nothing interactive yet


Major parts:

* viert.sh: low-level forth compiler. nasm and parse.pl
* viert3.asm: main assembler file, pulls in all other assembly stuff
* codewords.asm: words defined in assembler
* immediate.asm: Current "immediate" words are implemented as macros here
* macros.asm: various macros
* asmlib/: low-level asm stuff, ELF file creation, low-level debug functions
* parse.pl: parse forth file, create bytecode/nasm file that can be included by main asm structure
* oldwordset.asm: deprecated static lists of which codewords to include in a build
* compiled.asm: pseudoassembler/bytecode file generated by parse.pl

* optim.sh: optimizing compiler. concatenate library to forth file, run p2.pl, run ./f2
* p2.pl: optimizer/inliner/pruning
* f2: optimized forth generated by p2.pl. Also a shell script that runs viert.sh to compile
* wordset.asm: generated by p2.pl. Assembler words used.
